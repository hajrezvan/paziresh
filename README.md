# Educational System

## Overview
The **Educational System** is a software platform designed to facilitate learning and collaboration between students, teachers, and scientists. It includes modules for creating, editing, and visualizing formulas. This project is built using a combination of Python and custom Tkinter-based interfaces for a smooth user experience.

## Features
### User Roles
- **Scientists**: Can create, edit, and save complex formulas. They have access to advanced features like 3D graph plotting.
- **Teachers**: Can create and edit formulas, assign them to students, and review students' progress.
- **Students**: Can view assigned formulas, use the visual tools to explore them, and check their work.

### Key Features
- **Custom Code Editor**: A text editor for writing and editing formulas with error-checking capabilities.
- **3D Visualization**: A tool to visualize equations in 3D using Matplotlib.
- **Role-based Access**: Different levels of access for scientists, teachers, and students.
- **Formula Management**: Save and organize formulas in a central SQLite database.
- **Graphing Tools**: Visualize complex mathematical equations easily.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter)
- Matplotlib
- SQLite3 (for database)

Install required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install matplotlib customtkinter
```

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/educational-system.git
   cd educational-system
   ```

2. **Set up the Database**:

   Make sure the `db.sqlite` file is in the root directory of the project.

3. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
### Running the System
To start the system, simply run the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

### User Guide
1. **Login**: Users are required to log in using their credentials.
2. **Dashboard**:
   - Scientists can create and visualize formulas.
   - Teachers can assign formulas to students.
   - Students can view formulas and explore them using the 3D visualization tools.
3. **Formula Editor**: Access the code editor to write or edit formulas.
4. **Graph Visualization**: Use the `ChartDrawerApp` to visualize equations.
